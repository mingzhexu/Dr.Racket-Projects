# Dr.Racket-Projects
This projects file contains a series of interactive games, including Snake, Jezzball, Missile Defense and Bouncing Ball.<br />
I wrote the games using **Racket**, which is a functional programming language in the **Lisp/Scheme** family.
I implemented <code>Universe.rkt</code> and <code>Image.rkt</code> to animate and render the game; adopted <code>List</code>, <code>Abstraction</code> 
(such as <code>Map</code>, <code>Foldr</code>, <code>Filter</code>, <code>Sort</code>, etc.), 
self/mutural reference and accumulator to write as well as refactor the codes.
